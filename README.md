# Sorting-visualization
**Visualization of the main sorting algorithms**

This is repository for coursework "Visualization of basic sorting algorithms". Here lies the best practices stolen from the Internet and Zone-51, and carefully copy-pasted into the project by CS-24 group students _Ovechko Oleksandr_, and _Shulenko Yelizaveta_.

We ~~hope~~ are sure that we will manage to finish it before deadline and proudly present it to our classmates and a teacher.
